## My notes
It's an app I've made in less than 3 hours because as great as the comic is, the browser on mobile phones is lacking. 
Maybe I'll make some improvements in the future, maybe not. And if the author agrees, I may even add some fancy icon
and publish it to the app store.

The code is considered open-source. If you have some ideas for improvements, you can e-mail me.

Also if you worry about it having some spyware/ads - I mean, you have its source code here, and why would I even put 
ads to an app having a dozen users that shows content which isn't even made by me.
